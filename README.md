### Difficulties:
1. Understanding how to connect the information from the database with the bamazon app
2. Time management, as I focused on a problem for too long and lost track of the overall project

## What I learned:
1. I can sorta do stuff with mySql
2. Introduction to Markdown


### What would I do differently:
1. Work with people
2. Get good
